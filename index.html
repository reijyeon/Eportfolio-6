										<h4>In your opinion, how important your religion to you and to your own family?</h4>
										<h6></h6>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											Religion or rather having faith in God specifically is a very important part or aspect for me and my family, it helps an individual to know or distinguish things that are morally right and wrong, it instill values and beliefs that are useful in everyday life, especially it gives mental peace and emotional support, which encourage us to face our life and problems.

									<h4>Give 2 negative values and 2 positive values that Filipinos often do these days during COVID-19 pandemic. Explain your answers in detail.</h4>
									<br />
									<h4>Bayanihan Spirit (Positive Trait)</h4>
									<p style="font-size: larger; color: #f2f2f2;">
										In this time of crisis, we could see our fellow citizens, cooperate with one another to achieve a common goal, which is currently reducing the number of infected cases through wearing facemasks/face shields, practicing social distancing and doing precautionary measures to avoid the spread of the virus. Some families even sacrifice meeting each other, to prevent the risks of potentially transmitting the virus because it is especially hard nowadays to be safe. 
									</p>

									<br />
									<h4>Adaptability and resilience (Positive Trait)</h4>
									<p style="font-size: larger; color: #f2f2f2;">
										Despite the pandemic, Filipinos are still persistent, and continue to remain positive even in these difficult conditions we are facing. We strive hard to adapt by practicing the necessary safety measures, learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable in order to have the capacity to cope with unforeseen changes through this crisis.

										<h4>Crab Mentality (Negative Trait)</h4>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											When the pandemic hit our nation, and the people known how severe and dangerous the virus is, people started panic buying, hoarding so many items that are much more than what should suffice for them, scarcity became a problem especially in items like alcohol and facemasks, causing other people not have access or unable to buy them, some online sellers who bought abundant items, began to sell those items at a ridiculous price, not thinking about the welfare of other people only prioritizing their monetary gain.
										</p>
	
										<br />
										<h4>Lack of self-discipline (Negative Trait)</h4>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											There are many people who undermined the danger or severity of the virus, some of them refuse to wear mask and practice social distancing, which is very dangerous since they are putting others at risk by not following the regulations are being implemented. Fortunately, after some time people became more aware and adjusted to the new normal, in order to protect their selves and others in the process.
